WEBPACK
=======

Mode
----

Providing the `mode` configuration option tells webpack to use its built-in optimizations accordingly.

*Possible values for mode are: `none`, `development` or `production` (default).*

Documentation : https://webpack.js.org/concepts/mode/

The `--mode development` flag just adds default Webpack configurations which came with Webpack 4. You wouldnâ€™t need the flag for Webpack 3.

Usage :

Just provide the `mode` option in the config:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mode: 'production'
};
```

or pass it as a CLI argument:

```bash
webpack --mode=production
```
